# Youtube-dl_batch-QAI
This is a batchfile script that works as some sort of GUI for Youtube-dl

## Requirements

youtube-dl.exe (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/releases/latest)

## Setup

Place everything inside a folder.
The structure should be something similar to this:

- Folder

  - script.bat

  - youtube-dl.exe

## Usage

Just run yt-dl.bat

It should start a setup process in the first run, after that just give it a link and it will display the available formats

(I don't recommend using this with other pages other than youtube, but that will change later)
